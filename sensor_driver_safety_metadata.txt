The telematics data collected during driving trips are useful to detect if the trip is dangerous and has high crash / accident probability.

Data Schema (Field & Description):

sensor_data:
    - bookingID: trip 
    - accuracy: accuracy inferred by GPS in meters
    - bearing: GPS bearing in degree
    - acceleration_x: accelerometer reading at x axis (m/s2)
    - acceleration_y: accelerometer reading at y axis (m/s2)
    - acceleration_z: accelerometer reading at z axis (m/s2)
    (Acceleration determines the acceleration / vibration of the device in motion. Each of the axis can be thought of as a different sensor even though they reside on the same physical chip)
    - gyro_x: gyroscope reading in x axis (rad/s)
    - gyro_y: gyroscope reading in y axis (rad/s)
    - gyro_z: gyroscope reading in z axis (rad/s)
    (Gyroscope data determine the orientation of the device relative to earth's gravity)
    - second: time of the record by number of seconds
    - speed: speed measured by GPS in m/s

driver_data:
    - id: driver ID
    - name: driver's name
    - date_of_birth: driver's date of birth
    - no_of_years_driving_exp: number of years of driving experience
    - gender: driver's gender
    - car_make: brand of the taxi
    - car_model_year: when the car was manufactured
    - rating: driver's rating from customers (5 is the best and 2 is the worst)

safety_labels:
    - bookingID: trip
    - driver_id: driver ID
    - label: tags to indicate dangerous driving trip (0: Normal trip / 1: Dangerous trip)
